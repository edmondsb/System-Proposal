# System-Proposal
The System Proposal was written for a System Design class and the goal of the project was as follows:

Your primary purpose is to communicate to your client (and their associates) what your understanding of the
proposed system is.  However, this document will also serve as an intro-to-the-project for developer types who
join the project down the road.  Finally, creating this Proposal will help your developer team solidify their
understanding of the system to be built and document this understanding.

The System Proposal needs to be written in language non-technical types can understand, so they can read it
and determine if your analysis 1) makes sense and 2) matches what they believe they want and need.  All
readers should be assumed to be “busy” readers who want to and need to be able to quickly find the
information they need in order to complete their project-oriented tasks.
